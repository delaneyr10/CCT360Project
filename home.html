			Stranger Things is the latest Netflix pop-culture phenomenon of 2016-2017. It's a horror, mystery, comedy show about kids, aliens, alternate dimensions, and an homage to the '80s. This is a great show with so much to offer and there's something for everyone- the stories and characters are great, the cast is perfect, and the visuals are stunning. Once you get past the element of horror (if you're not a fan of horror), you'll just start to fall in love with the stories and the kids. It's a story about love, friendship, family, science, adventure, discovery, and not being afraid to be a little, well, strange. Stranger Things really is a piece of artistic masterpiece of television. So what are you waiting for? Why are you keeping the curiosity door locked?
