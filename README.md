# CCT360Project
Final Project for CCT360 - Intermediate Web Design at Sheridan College

This was the final project for CCT360 - Intermediate Web Design at Sheridan College. The project was to design a website about
about anything we wanted and I decided to design a "fan sit" for Stranger Things. Other components of the project included
developing wireframes, information architecture, user personas, and navigation using best practices for web design and 
development.
